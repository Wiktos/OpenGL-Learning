# OpenGL-Learning
Simple opengl application which I was developing while learning Open Graphic Library (OpenGL).

In case you want to follow my learning process look at commits I made. I was making a lot of refactorization of application code and I was implementing lot of opportiunities connected with diffrent issues.
